Git was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, 
the same developer behind the Linux operating system kernel. 
At the time, 
the Linux kernel project relied on a proprietary version control system called BitKeeper.
 When the relationship between the Linux community and BitKeeper's developers broke down, Linus decided to create his own distributed version control system to manage the Linux kernel's development.

GIT stands for : Global information Tracker

The primary goals for Git were:

Speed: Git was designed to be fast, handling large projects efficiently.

Distributed Development: Developers could work independently and merge changes without relying on a centralized server.

Strong Support for Non-linear Development: Git was built to handle branching and merging with ease.

Data Integrity: It ensures that the history of changes is preserved securely.

Efficiency with Large Projects: Git was tailored to handle the massive codebase of the Linux kernel.

The initial implementation of Git was a simple shell script prototype. It quickly evolved into the robust tool we know today, thanks to contributions from the open-source community. Since then, Git has become the most popular version control system in the world, used by millions of developers and organizations to track and collaborate on software development.

Git's rise to prominence has also been aided by platforms like GitHub, which was founded in 2008, and provides a user-friendly interface for hosting Git repositories, fostering collaboration, and building open-source projects.
